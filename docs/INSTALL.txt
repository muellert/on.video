on.video Installation
=====================


Using buildout
--------------

To install on.video using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

  * Add ``on.video`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    |      [buildout]
    |      ...
    |      eggs =
    |          ...
    |          on.video
       
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    |      $ ./bin/buildout


Runtime Configuration
---------------------

The product uses two settings for runtime configuration:

 * A file system path, accessible from the Plone site, where
   the product will be looking for the metadata files, splash
   images, etc.

 * An URL that will be used as a prefix to the actual video
   files. This will be part of all generated URLs, and makes
   it possible to serve the videos eg. from a different server
   altogether, or to break out an URL prefix from your site and
   redirect it to the file system where the video files are
   stored.

To actually work with the product, you need to also place a flowplayer
binary in the directory that serves as the root of the tree pointed to
by the URL setting of the product (you can use the configlet, or
access the registry to change these).

The (file) name of the player is set in the PLAYER variable in
``config.py``.


End User Perspective
--------------------

The end user adds videos much like any other content type, but instead
of uploading large blobs to the ZODB, he specifies the base path of
the metadata file.

Example:

The file system path is set to ``/tmp``. The video metadata file is at
``/tmp/myvideo/test.metadata``. Then, the user specifies
``myvideo/test`` in the video file field of the edit form. For the
contents of the metadata file(s), please see the README.



Notes
-----

The video object in the ZODB will be completely independent of the
video data that resides on the file system, and you can freely move
the video objects around without touching the file system. For folders
and new style collections, you can enable a video gallery view that
displays summary information for videos and contained folders, but
removes all other items, except for images, from the display. So if
you have a video gallery enabled for a folder and a page within that
folder, you will not see it.

The video and metadata files are intended to be generated and
deposited on the file system by processes outside of Zope, thus making
the video handling inside of Zope a lean experience.
